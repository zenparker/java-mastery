# Java Mastery

A comprehensive learning journey through Java programming, organized in phases to build expertise from fundamentals to advanced topics.

## Overview

This repository contains a structured curriculum designed to master Java programming from the ground up. The content is organized in phases, covering everything from basic setup to advanced concepts like streams and lambda expressions.

## Repository Structure

The project is organized into six main phases:

### Phase 1: Setup & Fundamentals
- Days 1-2: Setup & First Code
- Days 3-4: Core Operations  
- Days 5-7: Control Flow

### Phase 2: Arrays & Math
- Days 8-10: Arrays
- Days 11-12: Math Class
- Days 13-14: Strings

### Phase 3: Methods & Collections
- Week 3 (Days 15-21): Methods, ArrayList, LinkedList, HashMap, HashSet, TreeSet, Queue, Stack
- Week 4 (Days 22-24): PriorityQueue, Collections Utility Class, Comparator & Comparable

### Phase 4: OOP Quick
- Days 29-31: OOP Basics
- Days 32-35: OOP Core Concepts

### Phase 5: Exception Handling & Extras
- Days 36-38: Exception Handling
- Days 39-40: Important Additions
- Days 41-42: Best Practices & Review

### Phase 6: Advanced Topics
- Week 7 (Days 43-48): Lambda Expressions, Streams API, Optional Class, Method References

## Learning Path

Each day builds upon the previous knowledge with practical examples and exercises. The progression is designed to gradually increase complexity while reinforcing fundamental concepts.

## Features

- Comprehensive coverage from basics to advanced topics
- Practical examples and demonstrations
- Exception handling best practices
- Object-oriented programming principles
- Collections framework mastery
- Modern Java features (Lambda expressions, Streams)
